                <p class = "card-text">The surcharge of $10,000 is applied to cover the additional costs associated with providing an orbital tour experience. Unlike regular space tourism flights, which operate at suborbital altitudes, an orbital tour takes you into Earth's orbit, allowing you to experience weightlessness and witness the curvature of our planet from space. The technology, resources, and infrastructure required for such a mission are significantly more complex and expensive, hence the surcharge is necessary to cover these extraordinary expenses.</p>

                <p class = "card-text">The surcharge of $10,000 is due after you have successfully redeemed your tickets and confirmed your reservation for the orbital tour. At the time of booking, you will be required to pay the base cost of the tour, and the surcharge amount will be invoiced separately to ensure clarity and transparency in the payment process.</p>

                <p class = "card-text">Unfortunately, it is not possible to go on more than one orbital tour at the same time. Each orbital tour is meticulously planned and scheduled to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all participants. The complexities involved in orchestrating an orbital tour require careful coordination of resources, crew, and spacecraft availability. Therefore, it is not feasible to accommodate multiple tours simultaneously for a single individual.
<br>    However, if you are interested in experiencing multiple orbital tours, you can certainly book additional tours on separate occasions, subject to availability. Each tour offers a unique perspective and set of experiences, allowing you to further explore the wonders of space and gain a deeper understanding of our universe.</p>

                <p class = "card-text">Yes, there are age restrictions for participating in an orbital tour. Due to the physical and physiological demands of space travel, participants must meet certain age criteria to ensure their safety and well-being during the tour. The minimum age requirement for an orbital tour is typically set at 18 years old. This age restriction helps to ensure that participants have reached a level of physical maturity that can better withstand the unique conditions of space travel.
<br>Additionally, there may be an upper age limit, usually set at around 70 years old, to account for potential health considerations and the overall fitness required for the journey. However, the specific age restrictions may vary depending on the space tourism provider and the requirements set by the regulatory authorities.</p>
